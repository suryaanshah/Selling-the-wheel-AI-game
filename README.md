# Selling the Wheel AI Game
A text-based AI game about selling inspired from Selling the wheel book using HackClub's Orpheus.

Use this game to practice your selling skills and learn new sales strategies.

# Description - The story 
When a brand-new technology is created (for example when the wheel was invented) it goes through four phases: birth, fast-growth, incremental-growth, maturity.
In each of the phases, the familiarity of the tech increases amongst the people.
There are six bedrock questions for sales:
+ Who are my customers?
+ Who are my competitors?
+ Why do customers want what we are selling?
+ What would make them prefer to buy from us?
+ Why might they prefer to buuy from our competitors?
+ What added values does our salesperson have to offer to make a sale?

Each question is equally important. Selling is an art. This game and the book celebrates that art. 

# How to play this game
