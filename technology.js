var birth = "The 'birth' type of technology is new and revolutionary yet primitive. Products are capable of only basic tasks and have few if any features or options. During this period of infancy, apeal and value are limited to a relatively small number of people; but if the technology is successful, those few quickly become enthisiasts. As an example, when the wheel is invented, it is at this 'birth' stage initially."

When the wheel has been sold. As an example, after the stone wheel has been bought and used by a few gateswinger enthusiasts, and new wooden and spoked wheels are introduced; or the stone wheel starts to be used for griding."
